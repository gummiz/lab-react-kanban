# HackBoard a Kanban App

This Kanban app was created as part of our Ironhack full-stack web development bootcamp. Built following the React project brief, it showcases our ability to work with JSON data, create single-page applications, implement essential React features, navigate complex third-party documentation, and utilize routing within React. This project demonstrates the skills and understanding we have gained during our training.
